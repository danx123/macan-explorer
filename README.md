## Overview

Macan Explorer is an enterprise-grade file management application designed for users who need more than their operating system's default file browser. Built entirely in Python on top of the PySide6 / Qt6 framework, it delivers a clean frameless UI, multi-tab navigation, a powerful batch rename engine, a real-time activity log, and deep session persistence — all in a single self-contained Python file.

Version 6.0 — *"The Media & Workflow Release"* — builds on the v5 foundation with a focus on **media awareness**, **search ergonomics**, and **tab workflow**. It introduces a Quick View side panel, folder media thumbnails, video hover previews, inline scoped search, a proper "+" tab button, and full Recycle Bin integration via `send2trash`.

---


## Features

### 🗂️ Navigation
- **Multi-tab browsing** — open as many directory tabs as needed; tabs are movable and closable
- **"+" tab button** — embedded directly in the tab bar, always adjacent to the last open tab; click to open a new tab instantly
- **Breadcrumb navigation bar** — click any path segment to jump directly to that directory
- **Full history stack** — Back (`Alt+←`), Forward (`Alt+→`), Up (`Alt+↑`) with keyboard shortcuts
- **Address bar** — type or paste any path and press Enter to navigate instantly
- **Sidebar** with three independently resizable panels:
  - **Quick Access** — Home, Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos; uses OS-native folder icons from `QFileIconProvider`
  - **Drives** — live drive tree with right-click → Drive Properties (disk usage, free space, progress bar)
  - **Bookmarks** — drag folders in or use the + button; supports drag-and-drop from the file view

### 📋 File Operations
- Copy, Cut, Paste with clipboard-style queue across folders and tabs
- Drag-and-drop between the file view and sidebar bookmark list
- **Move to Recycle Bin** (`Del`) — sends items to the OS Recycle Bin / Trash via `send2trash`; falls back to permanent delete with confirmation if trash is unavailable
- Rename (inline `F2`), New Folder (`Ctrl+Shift+N`), New File
- Select All (`Ctrl+A`)
- Multi-file operations with a progress dialog for large batches
- Context menu for all operations with keyboard shortcut hints

### 🔍 View Modes
| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Details** | Table view with name, size, type, and date columns; sortable headers |
| **List** | Compact list view for dense directory browsing |
| **Icons** | Large icon grid with image thumbnails, video thumbnails, and folder media previews |

- View mode preference is persisted and restored per session

### 🖼️ Thumbnail Engine
- Instant image thumbnails for **PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, WEBP**
- Video thumbnails for **MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WEBM, FLV, WMV, MPG, MPEG** *(requires OpenCV)*
- **Folder media detection** — folders containing images or videos display a composite preview of their contents (up to 4 items in a 2×2 grid) instead of a plain folder icon
- **Video hover preview** — hovering over a video file shows a floating animated preview cycling through 8 frames sampled across the first 10 seconds; generated in a background thread, UI never blocks
- Thumbnails generated off the main thread via `QThreadPool` (up to 4 concurrent workers)
- MD5-hashed disk cache stored in `~/.macan_explorer/thumbnails/`
- **Clear Thumbnail Cache** available in the toolbar More menu

### 👁️ Quick View Panel *(F3)*
Preview files instantly without opening an external application.

- Toggled via `F3` or View → Toggle Quick View; appears as a resizable dock on the right side
- Automatically previews whichever single file is selected in the active tab
- **Image viewer** — renders the image scaled to the panel width; re-scales live as the panel is resized
- **Text & code viewer** — monospaced reader with UTF-8 / Latin-1 auto-detection, truncated at 256 KB. Supports 40+ extensions including:
  `txt`, `md`, `log`, `json`, `yaml`, `toml`, `csv`, `xml`, `html`, `css`,
  `js`, `ts`, `py`, `java`, `c`, `cpp`, `h`, `rs`, `go`, `sh`, `bat`, `sql`, `rb`, `php` and more
- **Video viewer** — displays a representative frame extracted at the 2-second mark *(requires OpenCV)*
- **Unsupported types** — shows a clear "No preview available" notice
- Metadata bar shows filename, image dimensions (where applicable), and file size

### 🔎 Inline Search *(Ctrl+F)*
- Search bar appears **inside the current file view** — no separate dialog
- Two modes via drop-down:
  - **Real-time** — filters as you type with a 300 ms debounce
  - **Manual** — results update only on `Enter` or clicking **Search**
- Search is **scoped to the current folder only** — direct children of the active path
- Live match counter (`12 matches`, `1 match`)
- Filter clears automatically when navigating to a different folder
- Press `Esc` or `✕` to dismiss and restore the full file list

### ✏️ Smart Rename *(Ctrl+R)*
A full-featured batch rename engine with live preview and undo support.

**Tab 1 — Find & Replace**
- Multi-pattern rules in `pattern, replacement` pairs (e.g. `LK21-, , (2023), `)
- Prefix and Suffix injection
- Case conversion: No Change / lowercase / UPPERCASE / Title Case / camelCase / snake_case
- Extension override (e.g. `.txt`, `.jpg`)
- Remove special characters option
- Replace spaces with custom character option

**Tab 2 — Numbering**
- Auto-increment counter appended to each filename
- Configurable start number, zero-padding width, and separator character

**Tab 3 — Regex**
- Full Python `re`-compatible pattern matching
- Capture group substitution with `\1`, `\2`, etc.
- Enable/disable toggle so the tab is non-destructive by default

**Live Preview Table** — updates in real time as you type; renamed entries are highlighted in accent color.  
**Preview Dialog** — review the full before/after diff before committing.  
**Undo Last Rename** — reverses the entire most-recent batch in one click.

> The Smart Rename panel is hidden by default and does not consume screen space until needed. Open it with **Ctrl+R**.

### 📝 Activity Log
- Color-coded log entries by operation type: `INFO`, `NAV`, `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, `COPY`, `MOVE`, `RENAME`, `CREATE`, `DELETE`
- Every file operation (navigate, copy, cut, paste, rename, delete, create, bookmark, terminal launch, theme switch, cache clear) is logged automatically
- **Export** log to a `.txt` file
- **Clear** log with one click
- Monospaced font view with auto-scroll

> The Activity Log panel is hidden by default. Enable it via View → Toggle Activity Log.

### 🎨 Theme System
- **Dark theme** (default) — deep navy/slate palette with purple accents (`#7C3AED`)
- **Light theme** — crisp white/slate palette with matching purple accents
- Toggle with `Ctrl+D` or the toolbar button
- All SVG icon strokes re-rendered on theme switch:
  - Dark: `#e0e0e0` (light gray on dark backgrounds)
  - Light: `#374151` (dark gray on light backgrounds)
- Frameless window controls (minimize/maximize/close) adapt to both themes
- Status bar and toolbar button text adapt to both themes
- Theme preference persisted across sessions

### 💾 Session Persistence (QSettings)
All of the following survive application restart:

- Window size and position
- Dock panel visibility (Activity Log, Smart Rename, Quick View)
- Dock panel layout and positions
- Smart Rename field values (all tabs)
- Sidebar splitter proportions
- View mode (Details / List / Icons)
- Show/hide hidden files toggle
- Theme selection
- Bookmark list

### 🖥️ Terminal Integration
- **Open Terminal Here** (`Ctrl+T`) launches the system terminal in the current directory
- Platform detection:
  - **Windows** → `cmd.exe`
  - **macOS** → `Terminal.app`
  - **Linux** → auto-detects: `gnome-terminal`, `xterm`, `konsole`, `xfce4-terminal`, `lxterminal`

### 🪟 Multi-Window
- Open a full independent application window with `Ctrl+N`
- Each window maintains its own tab set, settings, and navigation history

## Configuration & Persistence

Macan Explorer stores its data in two locations:

### Application data — `~/.macan_explorer/`
```
~/.macan_explorer/
├── macan_explorer_config.json   # Bookmarks, view mode, theme, show-hidden flag
├── thumbnails/                  # MD5-hashed video thumbnail cache
└── logs/
    ├── shrine_ritual_log.txt    # General application log (rotating, max 1 MB × 5 backups)
    └── error_log.txt            # Error-only log (rotating, max 1 MB × 5 backups)
```

### QSettings — OS native store
Session state (window geometry, dock layout, Smart Rename field values, sidebar splitter sizes, Quick View visibility) is stored via Qt's `QSettings` under:

| Platform | Location |
|---|---|
| Windows | `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Macan Angkasa\Macan Explorer` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Preferences/com.macan-angkasa.Macan Explorer.plist` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Macan Angkasa/Macan Explorer.ini` |

To reset all session state, delete the relevant QSettings key or file.

## Architecture Overview

Macan Explorer is structured around a **signal-driven MVC-like pattern**:

- **Model layer:** `ThumbnailIconProvider` (extends `QFileSystemModel`) is the single source of truth for directory data; `SortFilterProxyModel` handles sorting, hidden-file filtering, and the scoped search filter.
- **View layer:** `FileView` renders the model in three switchable view modes via `QTreeView` / `QListView`; all interaction emits signals upward. The inline search bar lives inside `FileView`.
- **Controller layer:** `MainWindow` wires signals from `FileView`, `CommandBar`, `Sidebar`, `TabManager`, and all dock panels into coordinated actions.
- **Worker threads:** `FolderSizeWorker`, `ThumbnailWorker`, and `VideoPreviewWorker` run in shared `QThreadPool` instances; results are emitted via `Signal` and consumed on the main thread.
- **Persistence:** `QSettings` handles session state; `ConfigManager` (JSON) handles user data (bookmarks, preferences).

```
MainWindow
 ├── TitleBar              ← drag move, window controls, theme-aware icons
 ├── CommandBar            ← toolbar actions, address bar, search, theme-aware icons
 ├── BreadcrumbBar         ← path segments → navigate signal
 ├── Sidebar               ← QSplitter [QuickAccess | Drives | Bookmarks]
 ├── TabManager            ← n × FileView tabs + "+" dummy tab
 │    └── FileView         ← ThumbnailIconProvider + SortFilterProxyModel
 │         ├── InlineSearchBar   ← real-time / manual scoped filter
 │         └── VideoHoverPreview ← floating frame-animation overlay
 ├── ActivityLogDock       ← QDockWidget (bottom, lazy-loaded)
 ├── SmartRenameDock       ← QDockWidget (bottom, tabified, lazy-loaded)
 └── QuickViewDock         ← QDockWidget (right, lazy-loaded)  ★ new
      └── QuickViewPanel   ← image / text / video preview
```

## Known Limitations

- **Single-pane layout** — dual-pane (commander-style) browsing is not available in v6.
- **No network/FTP paths** — remote path browsing is not supported; local filesystem only.
- **Video features require OpenCV** — if `cv2` is not installed, video files show a generic icon; hover preview and video Quick View are disabled.
- **Recycle Bin requires `send2trash`** — without it, deletion is permanent (with confirmation). On network drives or certain Linux configurations, `send2trash` may fall back to permanent deletion even when installed.
- **Undo scope** — the undo feature in Smart Rename covers only the last batch operation; general filesystem undo (copy/paste/delete) is not implemented.
- **Search is current-folder only** — recursive search across subdirectories is not yet available from the inline bar.
- **No PDF preview** — PDF rendering libraries add significant binary weight and memory overhead that conflicts with the application's single-file, lightweight design goal.
